# Development Environment

## Installation of QtCreator 5.3 on unbuntu linux 14.04
Download Qt >= 5.31 online installer and run it

    $ chmod 755 qt-opensource-linux-x64-1.6.0-4-online.run
    $ sudo qt-opensource-linux-x64-1.6.0-4-online.run

and install it to any location (/opt/Qt) is okay.
Default selection of packages is ok, just make sure x86_64, armv7 are
selected for Qt and QtCreator is selected for tools.

## Compile Application
See [qt docs](http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-3.0/creator-developing-android.html)
on how connecting android devices.
If configured correctly, just hit deploy button and wait for the application
 to start on your android device.

# Set up Raspberry Pi

## Installation of latest Raspbian
See [installing images on linux](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)

### Download
[Download](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
zip image for Raspbian (debian wheezy) and unzip it.

### Write SD
Insert empty SD card and make sure its not mounted Check the device name of
the inserted SD card

    $ dmesg | tail

it should print some information about the last connected device or so.
You need the device name like [sdb] or [sdc]. Don't make a mistake here or you
might mess up one of your working devices!

Copy image to SD card:

    $ sudo dd bs=4M if=2014-06-20-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdX

put the device later instead of the last X

### Boot Pi and upgrade
Place SD card into PI and connect LAN, monitor and keyboard.
In the software configuration select

* Expand Filesystem
* Advanced options -> ssh -> enable

and reboot. If connected via LAN you can now use ssh to connect to your PI.
Default password for user pi is *raspberry*.

To set locale do

    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

You can select en_US.UTF-8. Relogin to apply locales for your terminal.

To upgrade run

    $ sudo aptitude update
    $ sudo aptitude upgrade
    $ sudo rpi-update

### Download and install PiBlaster software
You can download and create the piblaster package right on your PI, all you
need is cmake

    $ sudo aptitude install cmake gdebi-core

You can skip this if you install a pre-packed package and install the
dependencies by hand.

Now clone the git repo and create the package

    $ cd /tmp
    $ git clone https://github.com/ujac81/PiBlaster.git
    $ cd PiBlaster/Pi/PyBlaster/
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cpack

To install the package with dependencies run

    $ sudo gdebi pyblaster-0.2.6-armhf.deb

## Configure Raspberry Pi

### Hifiberry DAC/AMP/...

Unblacklist i2c from */etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf* (just comment
out both lines)
Follow instructions on [Hifiberry site](http://www.hifiberry.com/guides/hifiberry-software-configuration/) and make sure not to load the onboard
sound module in */etc/modules*. Also make sure to have made the Hifiberry made
default in */etc/asound.conf*.

### Better Sound / Equalizer
If you want to install a software equalizer and enhance the sound quality
by best speex encoding do:

    $ sudo aptitude install libasound2-plugin-equal  libasound2-plugins

And add

    defaults.pcm.rate_converter "speexrate_medium"

to */etc/asound.conf*. You can also try "speexrate_best", which will consume
more CPU, but not provide way better results. See [alsa-dox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#High_quality_resampling).

For the equalizer add some lines to the */etc/asound.conf*. Together with the
Hifiberry device, mine looks like

    pcm.!default  {
     type hw card 0
    }
    ctl.!default {
     type hw card 0
    }
    ctl.equal {
     type equal;
    }
    pcm.plugequal {
     type equal;
     slave.pcm "plughw:0,0";
    }
    pcm.equal {
     type plug;
     slave.pcm plugequal;
    }

    defaults.pcm.rate_converter "speexrate_medium"

To test your equalizer, use

    $ alsamixer -D equal
    $ mplayer -ao alsa:device=equal Foo.mp3.

**Note:** for later testing, make sure to run *alsamixer -D equal* as that user,
who is playing the music. If e.g. mpd is run as root, you will have to do
*sudo alsamixer -D equal* to get any effect of the equalizer.

### I2C
To use i2c to control amps or other devices, install

    $ sudo aptitude install i2c-tools

Unblacklist i2c from */etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf* (just comment
out both lines). Add

    i2c-dev
    i2c-bcm2708

to */etc/modules* and reboot.
Wire your I2C device to:
 * 3.3V: Vi2c
 * GPIO2: SDA (Raspberry PI B+ -- check for your device!!!)
 * GPIO3: SCL (Raspberry PI B+ -- check for your device!!!)
 * GROUND: GND
[Example for MAX9744 board using i2c](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-20w-stereo-audio-amplifier-class-d-max9744/digital-control)

To control the amplifier mentioned above, use i2cset from command line:

    $ sudo i2cset -y 1 0x4b 0x0 20

Where *1* is the i2c bus id, *0x4b* is the device id of the amplifier
(found via *i2cdetect -y 1* or from documentation), *0x0* is the internal address
for the volume setting and *20* is the volume value between 0 and 63 for this amp.
Be careful, a setting of 35 or 40 might be very loud.
**Note:** This applies for the MAX9744 class D amplifier board from adafruit.
Your settings might differ.


### Configure IR
Follow instructions on
[this page](http://ozzmaker.com/2013/10/24/how-to-control-the-gpio-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-an-ir-remote/)
to wire and configure the remote control.

For a generic remote, use the lirc_rpi module with an extra option to tell
which pin to use in GPIO mode (not board mode!).
To load the module on boot, add these lines to */etc/modules* file

    lirc_dev
    lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=25

Tell lirc to use the default drivers.
Settings in */etc/lirc/hardware.conf* should be

    LIRCD_ARGS=""
    LOAD_MODULES=true
    DRIVER="default"
    DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
    MODULES="lirc_rpi"
    LIRCD_CONF=""
    LIRCMD_CONF=""

No teach the remote control. Google for irrecord or find a lircd.conf that
matches your remote. To record use

    $ sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf

Store the file to */etc/lirc/lircd.conf*.
For my controller it looks like this:

    # Please make this file available to others
    # by sending it to <lirc@bartelmus.de>
    #
    # this config file was automatically generated
    # using lirc-0.9.0-pre1(default) on Tue Oct  8 07:05:38 2013
    #

              KEY_STOP                 0x609F
              KEY_VOLUMEUP             0x40BF
              KEY_VOLUMEDOWN           0x00FF
          end codes

    end remote

The key naming is free, but there is an unwritten standard for the key
naming. So maybe just use these names.

Now lirc daemon should be started on boot.
To tell your application how to use the lirc commands, you need to configure
the *.lircrc* file of the user running the application.
As PiBlaster is run as root at the moment, place the file to */root/.lircrc*

    begin
      button = KEY_PAUSE
      prog = pyblaster
      config = playpause
    end

    begin
      button = KEY_UP
      prog = pyblaster
      config = playprev
    end

    begin
      button = KEY_DOWN
      prog = pyblaster
      config = playnext
    end

    begin
      button = KEY_VOLUMEUP
      prog = pyblaster
      config = volinc
      repeat = 2
    end

    begin
      button = KEY_VOLUMEDOWN
      prog = pyblaster
      config = voldec
      repeat = 2
    end

The pyblaster software will check lircrc for commands for the program
pyblaster and lirc will send the commands given after the config keyword to it.
For the volume increase and decrease command we allow repeat (hold key works).

To run other commands via remote controller, you will have to start the irexec
daemon, but its not required for pyblaster to work.

## Configure PiBlaster

### Run mode
Per default PyBlaster will start on boot in terminal mode. This means it won't
daemonize silently and just do its work, but will print to boot console.
In terminal mode it will also prevent blanking of the screen.
This is good for development/debugging, but might not be the right thing for
you. To enable/disable terminal mode, check */etc/default/pyblaster* file.



## Faster Boot for Raspberry PI

### Set Static Network Address
If using model B, set a static ethernet address in */etc/network/interfaces*
like

    auto lo

    iface lo inet loopback
    iface eth0 inet static
            address 192.168.178.26
            gateway 192.168.178.1
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            dns-nameservers 192.168.178.1

    allow-hotplug wlan0
    iface wlan0 inet manual
            wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


And set your nameserver in */etc/resolv.conf*

    nameserver 192.168.178.1

### Overclocking
To overclock your Pi while add this to */boot/config.txt*

    arm_freq=1000
    core_freq=500
    sdram_freq=600
    over_voltage=6
    force_turbo=1

**Note:** Higher values will set a sticky bit inside the Pi and your warranty
will be voided. This will boost your boot time by ~50%, but will lead to a
higher power consumption. Also your Pi might run unstable. You have to play
with the overclock settings to find something that suits your requirements.
I disabled overclocking for my Pi because I want to save power and I found
that my Pi runs unstable with these settings.
